# Lecture 14: Array Rearrangement
# In this lecture, we will discuss a problem based on Array rearrangement. Here we have been given a permutation array ‘Arr[N]’ and we have to rearrange it such that - if Arr[ i ] = j, then Arr[ j ] = i.
# Input: Arr[4] = { 1, 3, 0, 2 }
# Output: Arr[4] = { 2, 0, 3, 1 }
#
# Approach:
#
# Using a temporary array - When we try to place the elements at their new indices at that time we may lose the old elements present at those indices. Therefore we can use a temporary array to store the elements at their desired position.
# Time complexity: O(N)
# Space complexity: O(N)
#
# Can we do it without using any auxiliary array?
#
# The problem while replacing the old value with the new value is that the previous elements are being overwritten. But can not we do it in a cycle?
# Yes, we can!
# Cycles
# But as evident from the figure, there may not necessarily be a single cycle. It can contain multiple cycles and thus we would need to track if an element has already been modified in some other cycle or not.
#
# For this, we can make use of the fact that 0<=Arr[ i ]<=N-1, therefore we can add 1 to the elements and multiply them by -1.
# ie. If element at index ‘i’ has been visited then, Arr[ i ] -> - ( Arr[ i ] + 1 )
#
# Time complexity: O(N)
# Space complexity: O(1)
